# Poker-Night - Unity

You can play it here: https://thisisdaniel81.itch.io/poker-night
See controls under description there

Created using Unity in C#. Triggers and UI elements were created using native Unity objects. 

Dialogue sorted and created using Ink.

If you're here to test the game, execute the .exe in /demo.

But for everyone else, this is a rushed job meant to educate you on the basics of ink.

The two C# scripts in /src are there to show how dialogue is triggered and how its handled through ink's many custom variables and arrays.

And /Dialogue contains all the ink files used during the production of this game.

	Here is the order:

		stanley
		chair (not important)
		mitch
		
Have a good one!
